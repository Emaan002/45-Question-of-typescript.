// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function carData(manufacturer: string, model: string, price: number, color: string, year: number) {
    let car = {
        manufacturer,
        model,
        price,
        color,
        year,
    };
    return car;
}

let myCar = carData("TOYOTA","Camry",500000, "purple", 2022);
console.log(myCar);
