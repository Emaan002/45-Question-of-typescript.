// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function carData(manufacturer, model, price, color, year) {
    var car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
        price: price,
        color: color,
        year: year,
    };
    return car;
}
var myCar = carData("TOYOTA", "Camry", 500000, "purple", 2022);
console.log(myCar);
