// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function makeGreat(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] += " the Great";
    }
}
var magicians = ["Sikandar", "Fazal", "Imran", "Aadi"];
makeGreat(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
